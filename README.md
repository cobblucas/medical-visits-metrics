**Description:** This project employs visualizations, including AI-driven smart narratives, pie charts, and bar graphs, to offer insights into the evolution of medical visits over time. The dataset consolidates information from various sources, presenting coherent time-series data on total patients tied to revenue. To examine individual departments, users can utilize the slicers located towards the top of each page.

The analysis delves into patients overview and insights across multiple pages, incorporating pie charts and tabular data matrices. These visual representations illustrate a total patients by department, age group and race.

Additionally, the project conducts a detailed examination of capacity limits, distinguishing between beds available versus admissions, with a specific emphasis on beds by department and showcases availability across hospital units.

Lastly, the focus shifts to patient experience, exploring customer ratings by department. The analysis also considers the rating count by job title and department.
